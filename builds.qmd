## Spiritum

The Spiritum app was unfortunately built in Microsoft Access 2010, so it is not really open source. I have done a QI project on this however and there is a poster PDF people can look at:

## Quick Spiritum

The Quick Spiritum RPA program is however open source but I have been asked by the trust I worked out to make the repository private. If anyone would like to access the code, please contant me.

I have done an FCI hosted webinar on this program, which can be seen at:

## Spiritum Duo

I have spoken both about the RPA program “Quick Spiritum” and the digital pathway work “Spiritum Duo” on an NHS SCW podcast:

The GitHub code for the cancer pathway is housed at:

The logo that I design for Spiritum Duo is attached. The idea behind logo this is a dandelion being blown. As Spiritum Duo is latin for “breath two”, I thought it was a nice idea for a logo.

## Digital Clinical Safety Plateform

The Digital Clinical Safety Plateform is a system to streamline and simplify writing clinical safety documentation. The code can be found at:
