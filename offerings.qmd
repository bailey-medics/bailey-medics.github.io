I am free for most things digital and healthcare. However, my main interests lie in:

* Coding
* Building great apps to improve healthcare delivery
* Digital health education
* Stakeholder engagement.
* Locum work in medicine / respiratory.

Please see the [Let's Do Digital](https://letsdodigital.org) website for educational offerings relating to digital healthcare.
